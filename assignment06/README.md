# Assignment 06  
This program will generate random directed graphs with capacity and calculate the max flow using Edmonds Karp algorithm.  
## Get started
We use python3 and libraries: networkX and pydot. Please install them.   
Please create ```./input``` and ```./output``` directory for the created dot files. We provide some examples in ```./input_graphs``` and ```./output_graphs```. One time execution will generate ten graphs and max flow graphs. 
To run: ```python3 main.py```.
